# Autonote
*Python note automation, to make note taking less painful*
## What is this
This is a simple python and shell script used to automatically create a new folder and text document. Once the folder and file has been created, it will then open the file in your text editor of choice.

## Useage
To use Autonote, and create a new folder and file run the below command in your terminal

*ane Folder_name name_of_file .extension_name*

Folder_name is the name of the folder you would like to store your new note in.

name_of_file is the name of your new file

.extension_name is your file type

### Acceptable file types are the following
.txt for text

.java for java

.python for python

## Installation
Unforutunately installing Autonote isn't the most elegant

### Fish Shell
